A reward machine is defined as following:\nGiven a set of propositional symbols $\\mathcal{P}$, a set of (environment) states $S$, and a set of actions $A$, a reward machine (RM) is a tuple $R_{PSA}=<U, u_0, F, \\delta_u, \\delta_r>$, where $U$ is a finite set of states, $u_0 \\in $ is an initial state, $F$ is a finite set of terminal states (where $U \\cap F = \\emptyset$, terminal states are not existed in $U$), $\\delta_u$ is the state-transition function, $U \\times 2^{P} \\rightarrow U \\cup F$, $\\delta_r$ is the reward-transition function, $U \\rightarrow [U \\times U \\rightarrow \\mathcal{R}]$.\nA reward machine $R_{PSA}$ starts in state $u_0$, and at each subsequent time is in some state $u_t \\in {U \\cup F}$. At every step $t$, the machine receives as input a truth assignment $\\sigma_t$, which is a set that contains exactly those propositions in $P$ that are currently true in the environment. For example, in an open door and get the key game,  $\\sigma_t={e}$ if the agent open the door $e$, while $\\sigma_t={k}$ if the agent get the key $k$. Then the machine moves to the next state $u_{t+1}=\\delta_u(u_t, \\sigma_t)$ according to the state-transition function, and outputs a reward function $r_t=\\delta_r(u_t)$ according to the state-reward function. This process repeats until the machine reaches a terminal state. Note that reward machines can model never-ending tasks by defining $F = \\emptyset$.","date":""},{"role":"system","content":"Environment Description:\nHalfCheetah is part of the Mujoco environments. This environment is based on the work by P. Wawrzyński in “A Cat-Like Robot Real-Time Learning to Run”. The HalfCheetah is a 2-dimensional robot consisting of 9 body parts and 8 joints connecting them (including two paws). The goal is to apply a torque on the joints to make the cheetah run forward (right) as fast as possible, with a positive reward allocated based on the distance moved forward and a negative reward allocated for moving backward. The torso and head of the cheetah are fixed, and the torque can only be applied on the other 6 joints over the front and back thighs (connecting to the torso), shins (connecting to the thighs) and feet (connecting to the shins). The robot need to go through 5 checkpoints c(x_position =2), e(x_position=4), f(x_position=6), g(x_position=8), and a(x_position=10). The agent gets a reward of 1000 when it reaches a and the control penalization (CP) otherwise.
